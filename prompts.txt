I am trying to compute cross-track geostrophic currents from along track
altimetry data which contains sea level anomaly(sla) and lon, lat data of the
ground track. For convenience, I have remapped the sla data as a function of
distance (s) from the coast. Now sla becomes a function s dimension. To compute
cross track geostrophic currents, I need to get the gradient of sla along
s which is d(sla)/ds and then multiply it with g/f where g is gravity as
function of lat and f is coriolis parameter as a function of lat. The satellite
ground track makes and angle of a with x-axis. At a given point on the tracks
del s = sqrt(del x ** 2 + del y ** 2). Now how do i compute zonal and
meridional components of currents from cross-track geostrophic currents. Give
mathematical formulation.

Write a python code that 
Draw two lines one making an angle of 70 and the other making 110 with
x-axis(measured counter clock wise from x-axis). Both lines start at the
x-axis but from different points.
Mark the intersection of the lines as P.
At the point of intersection draw a vertical arrow and horizontal arrow
pointing bothsides. Mark the vertical arrow as v bar (vector notation) and 
horizontal arrow as u bar (vector notation).
At point P, draw perpendicular lines to each of the two lines as a thin dotted
arrows extending both sides of the line. They have the same color as the
their perpedicular line.

There are two satellite altimetry tracks (T1, T2) that intersect at a point
P with an acute angle of theta. The cross track geostrophic current is computed
by differentiating the sea level anomaly (sla) along the track. The computed
geostrophic currents are normal to the track path. The geostrophic currents 
computed at the point P are g1 and g2 for the tracks T1 and T2 respectively. g1
and g2 are normal to the tracks T1 and T2 at point P. Now how do we deduce the
zonal and meridional components of currents at point P from g1 and g2? Deduce
the relation mathematically.

If we have only one track T1 and geostrophic current at point P is g1,
can we not decude u and v as g1*sin(theta1) and g2*cos(theta1)?

There are two othogonal vectors g1, g2 originating at (0, 0). There is a third
vector r (originating from same point) inbetween g1 and g2 which makes an
angle of theta with g2. Now how do we express vector r with respect to g1 and
g2?

There are two orthogonal vectors u (along x-axis) and v(along y-axis).
If a vector r makes an angle of theta with x-axis, how do we express r
interms of u and v. Note that u and v are not unit vectors.

There are two vectors g1, g2 originating at (0, 0). g1 makes an angle of a
with x-axis counterclock wise and g2 makes an angle of b with x-axis clockwise
. So g1 and g2 are position on the either sides of x-axis. How is the resulting
vector along x-axis expressed in term of g1 and g2.

Write a python code with following requirements
I have a bunch of ascending and descending tracks each of which are defined
by two arrays of longitudes and latitudes contained in netcdf files.
The code starts as follows.
for f in sorted(
    glob.glob(f"../data/ctoh.sla.ref.{sat}.nindian.*.nc")
):
    # print(f)
    ds = xr.open_dataset(f, engine="h5netcdf", decode_times=False)
    if len(ds.points_numbers) == 0:
        continue
    track_number = ds.pass_number
    lons_track = ds.lon.values
    lats_track = ds.lat.values
    lon_equat = lons_track[0]
    lat_equat = lats_track[0]
    lon_coast = lons_track[-1]
    lat_coast = lats_track[-1]
1. For each track define a shapely linestring, find the slope.
(assuming the track is linear and taking first and last points to find the
 slope and angle it makes with with equator as atan(slope))
2. For each track, check intersection points with other tracks and the
acute angle between the tracks.
3. We have to keep saving the tracknumber of self, tracknumber of other track
, intersection point, acute angle between them
