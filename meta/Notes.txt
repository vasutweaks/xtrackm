l.closest_descending_track_in_time.py not clear on what this script does

there is some problem with l.inter_track.dists_eq_sort.py 
the inter track distance between negative slope and positive slope tracks should be same. But they are differing alot.

ds.cycles_numbers and ds.cycle are differing only in initial values,
both are just integer values

previous .pass_number is changed to .Pass attribute
.Mission attribute is added to ds which can be useful
